### ASSIGNMENT 1 
##### *STEP - 1 - Launch your VMWare virtual machine.*
##### *STEP - 2 - Build a VM and ensure the Hypervisor supports layered virtualization.*
##### *STEP - 3 - When you set up a virtual machine, you have a few options to choose from.*
##### *STEP - 4 - In the virtual machine, I used Linux 20.0.04 LTS as the operating system.*
##### *STEP - 5 - Go to this repository and fork it on your own github account once you've downloaded and launched the OS.*Â 
##### *STEP - 6 - Utilizing git clone, clone the forked repository in the terminal.*
##### *STEP - 7 - Grab MakeFile after the repository has been cloned.*
##### *STEP - 8 - To run the Makefile, open the terminal in the parent directory where you cloned the repository and type make.*
##### *STEP - 9 - There's a chance you'll get licensing and version-related errors. To acquire the kernel versions, go to the clones linux directory and*
                       run cp /boot/config-5.
##### *STEP - 10 - For another phases, only a few libraries and packages are necessary.*
                   sudo apt install make
                   sudo apt install gcc
                   sudo apt install dwarves
                   sudo apt install flex
                   sudo apt install bison
                   sudo apt install libssl-dev
##### *STEP - 11 - Now we need to build a.config file with the data of the relevant kernel version config file in order to perform some make instructions.*
##### *STEP - 12 - Within the linux folder, run cp /boot/config-5.13.0-39-generic.config.*
##### *STEP - 13 - Run the command "'make oldconfig"'. To enter default values in a sequence of questions, simply hit return.*
##### *STEP - 14 - Because the version we're running now differs from the one pushed out in the previous phase, the oldconfig make command will only ask for the new things that aren't in the prior version.*
##### *STEP - 15 - Now run the command Make Prepare.*
##### *STEP - 16 - Run the command make -j x modules (where x = 4).*
##### *STEP - 17 - Run sudo make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 mdoules_install.*
##### *STEP - 18 - Run  the command sudo make install.*
